# Creating a Doubly Linked List in JavaScript

## Node Structure
In a doubly linked list, each node contains three components:
- **Data:** The actual value or information stored in the node.
- **Next:** A reference to the next node in the sequence.
- **Previous:** A reference to the previous node in the sequence.

```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(data, next = null, prev = null) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = next;
        this.prev = prev;
    }
}
```
The Node class is used to create individual nodes of the doubly linked list. The data property holds the value of the node, the next property points to the next node, and the prev property points to the previous node.

## Linked List Class
The linked list class is responsible for managing the nodes and providing operations for creating, modifying, and traversing the list.

```javascript
class DoublyLinkedList {
    constructor() {
        this.head = null; // Initially, the list is empty
        this.tail = null; // Reference to the last node
    }
}
```
## Conclution
The DoublyLinkedList class has a head property, which points to the first node in the list, and a tail property, which points to the last node. When the list is initially created, both head and tail are set to null indicating an empty list.
