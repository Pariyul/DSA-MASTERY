## Code Contribution Folder Structure

### For Data Structures Code Folders

Example:

- JavaScript-DSA `(folder)`
  - 01-Introduction `(folder)`
  - 02-Data-Structures `(folder)`
    - Linked-List `(folder)`
      - Operations `(folder)`
        - Singly-Linked-List `(folder)`
          - insertion.js or insertion.md `(file)`
          - deletion.js or deletion.md `(file)`
        - Doubly-Linked-List
          - insertion.js or insertion.md `(file)`
          - deletion.js or deletion.md `(file)`

### For Algorithms Code Folders

Example:

- 03-Algorithms
  - Greedy Method `(folder)`
    - Fractional-Knapsack-Problem.cpp `(file)`
  - Recursion `(folder)`
  - Divide and Conquer `(folder)`
